# Coffee-Value-Addition
This project focuses on enhancing transparency and efficiency in the coffee supply chain by 
integrating blockchain technology with predictive analytics. The coffee industry, despite its 
global significance, faces persistent challenges such as unfair pricing, supply chain 
inefficiencies, and lack of traceability. Farmers struggle with market access and demand 
forecasting, while distributors and consumers lack a reliable system to verify product 
authenticity and sustainability.
